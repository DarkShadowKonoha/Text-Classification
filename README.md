# Text-Classification

Naive Bayes classifiers are a collection of classification based around Baye's Theorem
Naive Bayes classifiers have been heavily used for text classification and text analysis machine learning problems.

## Baye's Theorem
We are given a target vector _y_ and data matrix _X_, then:
